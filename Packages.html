	In this article, you'll learn to divide your code base into clean, efficient modules using Python packages. Also, you'll learn to import and use your own or third party packages in a Python program.

 <h2>What are packages</h2>
 <p>
 	We don't usually store all of our files on our computer in the same location. We use a well-organized hierarchy of directories for easier access.
    As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear. 
    Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages and modules.

    A directory must contain a file named __init__.py in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.

<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>
  Here is an example. Suppose we are developing a game. One possible organization of packages and modules could be as shown:

 <h2>Importing Module from a Package</h2>
 We can import modules from packages using the dot (.) operator.

 For example, if we want to import the start module in the above example, it can be done as follows:
               import Game.Level.start
 Now, if this module contains a function named select_difficulty(), we must use the full name to reference it.
                   Game.Level.start.select_difficulty(2)
